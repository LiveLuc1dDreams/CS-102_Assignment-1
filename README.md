#Project Usage Instructions:



#Project Functionality:

The programs has three main functionality:
1. Reads an input file with formatted text representing students, courses, and course completions to be added to a database object
2. Turns the input from the input file into objects corresponding to the type of input found. 
3. Runs an interactive input for the user to display the courses, students, and completions sorted in various different ways. 


#Notes to be included in the final readme
-When adding a completion event to a student in a student database, if the student doesn't exist, 
the completion event will not be added to the database, and the function to add items to the database has to be run again if the student the completion event belongs to is lower in the input file.
