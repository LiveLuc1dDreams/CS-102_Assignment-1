# CS-102_Assignment-1

#Project Usage Instructions:

To use the program, hit the compile and run button to be prompted for input. 
There will be a set of instructions displaying the possible functions of the program
The input file will be read from a path specified by the variable in Assignment 2 main class
###Notes:
* When adding a completion event to a student in a student database, if the student doesn't exist, 
the completion event will not be added to the database, and the function to add items to the database has to be run again if the student the completion event belongs to is lower in the input file.
* Currently support for courses is not available, as the inplementation of the doubly linked circular list is not complete and therefore not implemented in the CourseDatabase class. 
#Project Functionality:

###The program has three main functionalities:
1. Reads an input file with formatted text representing students, courses, and course completions to be added to a database object
2. Turns the input from the input file into objects corresponding to the type of input found. 
3. Runs an interactive input for the user to display the courses, students, and completions sorted in various different ways. (currently not fully functional)
